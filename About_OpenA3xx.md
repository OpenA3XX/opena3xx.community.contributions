# The OpenA3xx Project

Welcome to the [OpenA3xx](https://github.com/OpenA3XX) project, a truly open source project for the Airbus A3xx family.

---

## About the project

The project was co-founded by David Bonnici and Mark Buhagiar.  
It came into existance after the desire to be build a home cockpit for the A3xx family, but no single point of reference on how to tackle  
that kind of project from the beginning.   
There were numerous sources of information out there, but nothing complete and all in one place.  

The OpenA3xx project aims to do just that. Whether you're a complete beginner with no experience in anything technical,  
or a seasoned flight sim enthustiast with a wide range of skills and knowledge, the OpenA3xx project will cater to your needs.

And all of this will be open source, with clear documentation and easy to understand step-by-step guidance.
The project will be an exciting DIY project for you to tackle, powered by open source hardware and software.
This is a high quality project, designed with low-cost in mind.

## How it works

So, that's all well and good we hear you say, but how does it all work?

Our team have designed open source hardware. This means the plans and designs are there free for you to see and use.
You can manufactuer the parts yourself, or use the plans to send off for them to be manufactured in a method of your choosing.

We are currently starting with the MCDU, but the project will develop other panels and instruments as the project grows.

Firstly, you can take the PCB designs and get them manufactured. You can choose how the boards are assembled, but   
they have been designed so that a novice can solder it all together themselves. You will find a 'bill' of components listing   
everything that you will need.

Secondly, you decide on how you want to manufacture the actual panel. Will it be 3D printed or CNC milled?
Our team have designed the 3D models, and they have been designed for the differences in 3D printing and CNC milling.
These designs are again, all open source and ready to download.
You assemble the parts together with the panel to complete the hardware interface.

Lastly, the open source software is downloaded and you configure the hardware to your system.
The software is a fantastic, easy to use and powerful system to run your hardware and communicate between it and the simulator.

## So, what does it REALLY cost?

To access everything that we've provided, its 100% free.   
A truly open source project from start to finish.   

The only cost is what you're willing to put into the parts and manufacturing.   
Regardless, it will be significantly cheaper than an 'off the shelf' model you can get online.
While we have nothing against these types of products, and some are very high quaity, what we are offering is the oppertunity to   
build one yourself from scratch and at a significantly cheaper price.   
The other advantage to this project being open source is that you can modify it any way that you wish.   

If something doesn't work for your needs, it can be modified and adapted.
If you'd like to submit your modifications back to the community, you can do so by sending a pull request to our repos.

## Current stages

We are nearing the point of an initial 'stable' release.   
Our 3D design work is going through the finishing touches, and prototypes will be manufactured soon.   
The PCB hardware is very nearly finished, and some boards have already been produced and assembled ready for testing.   
The community documentation and presentation is in the process of being assembled.   

All of our current work is free to be seen on the [OpenA3xx](https://github.com/OpenA3XX) project GitHub repos.
