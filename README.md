# OpenA3xx Community Contributions Documentation

This is the home of the community contributions and documentation for the [OpenA3xx](https://opena3xx.dev) project.

## About The Community Contributions

This is the single place to keep track of all the community contributions.  
You will find the guidelines around contributing and the decisions being made.  
It is designed to help organise ongoing projects, and establish who is already doing what, and the progress on that item.  
It is designed for collaboration, and edits are welcomed where required. So, please help us make this documentation better.  

The idea started in the discord: [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/d2Ck3SF4EY)

**The discord is a great place to communicate, get help and be sociable. Please stop by and consider joining us!**

## How To Contribute

Firstly, thanks for taking an interest on the project and wanting to help!  
We have many areas where people can offer their help and contribute to the project,  
whether it's coding, design, 3D modelling, social media, the list goes on!

The first thing we reccommend doing is to fork this repo to your own github, where you can make  
changes as you please. When you're ready, you can then send a pull request where the team will view your work  
and either suggest changes/reccommendations, or merge it into the main repo.

> <strong><em>But, wait! I don't know anything about GitHub, repos and pull requests?!</em></strong>

Not a problem! Plenty of people will be able to help out on the project and not know a single thing about this.  
We're here to help. Follow this guide, and if you have any more questions, feel free to drop a member of the team a message on Discord.

<h3><u>GitHub Guide</u></h3>

Start by creating an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join)  
Once logged into your account, goto the main [OpenA3xx community repo](https://github.com/OpenA3XX/opena3xx.community.contributions)  
In the top right corner of your screen, look for a button that says fork and looks like this:  
<img src="https://i.redd.it/upc6sexvri151.jpg" width="100" />  
This will then create a 'working copy' of the directory to your account.
You can upload, edit, remove whatever you like as you see fit. When you're happy with your changes/submissions, click <em>Pull Request</em>.  
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35271042/79503741-8c396a00-7fe6-11ea-97e5-8fd1b3059eb8.png" width="100" />  
Complete the title and a breif description outlinging your changes/submissions and click submit. The team will then review this and get back to you.  

A more detailed explantation can be found here:  
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">GitHub Documentation</a>

Ok, now we've got GitHub setup and running, you decide on how you wish to help out.
Please firstly check the 'Current Projects' section below to see if something is already being worked on,  
and if so, what stage it is at. If you wish to help out on that item, please contact the owner to seek guidance.
If you don't see the item you want to work on, then great! We would love your help!  
Check the 'Guidelines' section to check if there are any specific restraints or specifics you should adhere too.  
Then, it's all down to you!

    It's obviously a great idea to let us and others know what you're working on.
    It'll preent you working hard on something at the same time someone else is too!
    Also, we'll have an overview of what is currently being worked on, and where the project is at.
    So don't forget to add your contribution details to the 'Current Projects' section!

[//]: # (so I'm using HTML for more accurate and precise formatting.)
[//]: # (Please seek guidance if you're unsure on how to add/edit entries in this section.)
[//]: # (Worst case scenario, please add it to the 'Pending' box at the bottom of the section, and I'll add things as I see them.)

This section explains the style and design guidelines that have been chosen for each area of the project.  
Please read this section <strong><em>carefully</em></strong>, to make sure your contributions are in line with everyone elses work!

    We are currently working the 'MS 33558' which can easily be found on <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=MS+33558">Google</a>.
    This is still an open discussion, as there is a problem working with the font inside Fusion 360 etc.
