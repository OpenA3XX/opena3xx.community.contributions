# OpenA3xx Community Contributions Documentation

This is the home of the community contributions and documentation for the [OpenA3xx](https://opena3xx.dev) project.

## About The Community Contributions

This is the single place to keep track of all the community contributions.
You will find the guidelines around contributing and the decisions being made.
It is designed to help organise ongoing projects, and establish who is already doing what, and the progress on that item.
It is designed for collaboration, and edits are welcomed where required. So, please help us make this documentation better.

The idea started in the discord: [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/d2Ck3SF4EY)

**The discord is a great place to communicate, get help and be sociable. PLease stop by and consider joining us!**
